The main vehicle for exploitation of the CS-AWARE-NEXT project results (and thus the project’s pathways to impact) is the [CS-AWARE Corporation](https://cs-aware.com/), which intends to bring the project results to the market in the context of the CS-AWARE cybersecurity awareness and management platform. For further dissemination of project results, academic partners have interest in creating educational and research impact, while SMEs and industry partners have interest in advancing technological achievements and advancing the market introduction of project results.

CS-AWARE caters to two target markets: The NIS (Network and Information Security) sector market and the LPA (Local Public Administration) market. We have identified over one million European companies operating in the critical and important sectors defined by the NIS/NIS2 directive. According to Eurostat, there are around 96.000 European LPAs. This equals a serviceable available market (SAM) of around 1,1 million organizations, building the baseline for our assumptions of scale for the outcome/impact of each individual contribution below.

Regarding the significance, it is exceptionally hard to derive a baseline assumption for quantifying improvements in the context of cybersecurity R&I. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies available that would enable one to quantify specific aspects of cybersecurity, or the collaborative European cybersecurity framework. A recent ENISA study on NIS investments provides some interesting quantified insights into the state of NIS implementation in relevant European companies, but does not provide the means to derive a baseline against which the significance of CS-AWARE-NEXT contributions could be quantified, other than the statement that “82% of surveyed organisations acknowledge a positive impact of the NIS Directive on their security program”. Furthermore, the annual Accenture cost of cybercrime report provides interesting insights on potential cost savings (especially highlighting the potential in the context of threat intelligence, AI and user behaviour analytics), but this does not provide a relevant benchmark basis for improvements introduced by CS-AWARE-NEXT either. While CS-AWARE-NEXT is addressing the issue of the paucity of quantifiable data relating to cybersecurity by proposing a dynamic profiling and benchmarking framework (Objective 6) that is applicable to the fast-changing cybersecurity environment, we cannot rely on this framework yet to provide a sensible quantification of significance. We therefore derive our significance estimates from the perspective of an informed and expert judgement, based on the work and the validation results of the CS-AWARE project. This enables us to postulate an informed, and we believe, realistic estimate of improvement potential.

### Unique contribution 1: Improved organisational policy support for dynamic cybersecurity management

**Description:** A cybersecurity policy management framework for organizations that is able to deal with the dynamic and fast-changing cybersecurity requirements, and integrates with the cooperative/collaborative efforts of the European collaborative cybersecurity framework. It has the potential for significantly improving the cybersecurity of organizations (including intra-departmental and supply chain considerations) and to significantly reduce the success and impact of cyberattacks on organizations and their supply chains. It does this by enabling the operationalisation of tasks related to cybersecurity risk and incident management in an effective and efficient way (e.g. self-healing, disaster recovery, business continuity, preparedness, information sharing, collaboration, ...), contributing to the listed impacts.

### Unique contribution 3: Enable the use of threat intelligence and other relevant dynamic cybersecurity data (e.g. social media) in operational cybersecurity risk and incident management

**Description:** Threat intelligence is available in increasing volumes, not least due to the information shared in the context of the collaborative European cybersecurity framework. It’s use in operational cybersecurity risk and incident management is still hindered by the lack of operational tool support to be able to effectively and efficiently handle the large volumes of data continuously provided via threat intelligence. The AI based data collection and correlation engine provided by CS-AWARE-NEXT for this context has the potential for significant outcomes and impacts for dynamic cybersecurity management. It relates to most outcomes listed in the call topic, and the majority of impacts listed in the work programme destination.

**Target group:** 
*  Small, medium and large-sized (NIS sector/public) organizations

**Target group:** 
*  Small, medium and large-sized (NIS sector/public) organizations

**Mid-term impact:**

**Significance:** Operational capability of disaster recovery/ business continuity/ self-healing increased by 60% in organizations


### Unique contribution 5: Improved cybersecurity evidence collection and information sharing to connect organizations and local/regional level with multi-level European collaborative cybersecurity framework

**Description:** The ability to collect dynamic evidence of cybersecurity incidents from organizations and local/regional networks in an efficient and effective manner is crucial to the ability of relevant communities like competent authorities/CSIRTs to produce threat intelligence and thus to the success of the European collaborative cybersecurity framework. The CS-AWARE-NEXT contributions in this context have the potential for very significant outcomes and impacts.

**Significance:** Threat intelligence capability produced by relevant authorities raised by 60% Information exchange capability increased by 90% in target organizations


### Unique contribution 6: A KPI-based benchmarking and profiling framework to achieve shared situational awareness between individual organizations and other levels of the multi-level European cybersecurity framework

**Description:** Benchmarking and profiling in the context of cybersecurity management is traditionally highly individual and depends on the organizational context. There is currently no benchmarking and profiling approach available that allows to assess an organization against the baseline derived from other levels of the multi-level European cybersecurity framework, and the contribution has therefore a significant potential for outcomes and impacts in this context, providing organizations with quantifiable data of their security status and potential for improvement. This relates to the outcomes listed in the call topic concerning enhanced information sharing mechanisms and better preparedness. It relates on one way or another to all impacts listed in the work programme destination, including quantifiable security assurance.

*  Small, medium and large-sized (NIS sector/public) organizations

**Mid-term impact:** 
*  Enhanced mechanisms for exchange of information among relevant players
*  Better disaster preparedness against possible disruptions, attacks and cascading effects

**Long-term impact:** 
*  Strengthened EU cybersecurity capacities and European Union sovereignty in digital technologies
*  More resilient digital infrastructures, systems and processes
*  Increased software, hardware and supply chain security
*  Secured disruptive technologies
*  Smart and quantifiable security assurance and certification shared across the EU
*  Reinforced awareness and a common cyber security management and culture

**Type of outcome/impact (scientific, economic/technological, societal):**
* Scientific: The benchmarking and profiling framework - academic dissemination and standardization potential.
* Economic/technological: A reference implementation of the benchmarking and profiling framework (CS-AWARE platform)
* Societal: The societal impact of benchmarking and providing is expected to be an increase in cybersecurity in general through the ability to better assess and improve the security state of individual organizations
