The last report from Check Point Research, in August 2024, reveals the most recent data on the most prevalent cyberthreats in a global scale but also in Greece. Qbot software was the main threat in Greece, affecting 12.77% of the organisations. FakeUpdates was second, which affected 10.21% of the Greek organisations, while Androgyh0st reached 3.62%. A number of other significant threats include Tofsee (3.19%), Njrat (2,34%), Joker (1,91%), SnakeKeylogger (1,70%) and AsyncRat, which recorded a percentage of 1,70% both in Greece and globally. 

#### The situation in a global scale

Last month, RansomHub established its position as a top ransomware threat, as it is mentioned in a joint report by FBI, CISA, MS-ISAC and HHS. This RaaS mode attacks systems in a windows environment, macOS, Linux and mainly VMware ESXi, by using state-of-the-art encryption techniques. In August, an increase in Meow ransomware was noted, which ensured for the Ransomhub the second place in the top ransomware list for the first time. Coming from a variation of the Conti ransomware, Meow has relocated its focus, from encryption to data extraction, transforming, thus, the blackmailing page, into a data-leak marketplace. In this model, the stolen data are sold to the highest bidder, deviating from the traditional ransomware tactics.
