During November 2022 we held the Cyber Security Seminar and Workshops in Oulu, Finland. This four days event has been held since 1999 and brings together teachers, researchers, experts, and students of cybersecurity: https://www.oulu.fi/en/crim. 

CriM had twelve talks before lunch and three exercises in the afternoon, covering topics from incidence response to password handling. We were especially glad to hear a talk from Bart Preneel, Europe’s most pronounced cryptography expert, who reminded us at the end of his presentation to a quote from Immanuel Kant “Optimism is a moral duty”.  

This year we added an extra day to have a 6 hour long Cyber Exercise, hosted by AIT from Austria. Gregor Langner and Max Landauer guided students through a cyber security incident. Students had to analyse, coordinate the response, and take measures. 

We look forward to welcome you to the next CriM in November of 2023.
