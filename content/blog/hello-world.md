## Hello world!

Welcome to join our journey with CS-AWARE-NEXT, a cyber security research project funded by European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme! We will be updating the project's progress and informing you about our arranged events and achieved results in this page with brief blog posts. If you are interested to follow our progress, make sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cs_aware_next) to get notified when new posts are added so you don't miss them!

If you are an industry representative and want to find out more about the project and maybe even collaborate with us in this endeavour, you can contact the project coordinator for more information.
