We start today with a podcast in Greek with Elisavet Goutman, Business Development and Marketing Manager of OTS in Greece.

We are happy to announce the fourth podcast with Elisavet Goutman of OTS Greece. 
The reason we shall experiment with podcasts in national languages, namely not in English is rather simple: English can be our common working language for Deliverables, and can be ideal for reaching out researchers, but if we truly want to walk the last mile and increase the visibility of the project to a large audience in the participating countries, then the best is to create content in the different national languages.

Some information about Elisavet:

Elizabeth Goutman has been working as a Marketing Manager at Open Technology Services SA (OTS), a Greek Software Company, since 2020. Prior to that, she has been working in the Marketing Department of KLEEMANN, where she was in charge of the the localisation of the brand identity of the company. Cross-cultural events and local market analysis were a part of her job description. Her studies were initially in the field of Physical education and Sports, from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. She received her degree with a specialisation in Sports Marketing in 2002. She obtained a Postgraduate Degree from Loughborough University, England, in 2005. From there on she took on marketing and has been working in the field ever since.
And here are the questions:

1.	OTS had been involved in the previous project in turn since 2017, so you have more than six years of accumulated experience. During this time, what signs have you observed in the Greek market, particularly in the public and wider public sector? If, for example, the issue of digital infrastructure security was something of peripheral or marginal interest at the time, whereas today it has been upgraded.
2.	How easy or how difficult is it to get across the importance of a service whose customers cannot recognise or, to some extent, quantify the benefit of whatever investment they need to make?
3.	As a company, OTS has made a name for itself with products and services that have helped with what we used to call 
'computerisation' and would now, more excitingly, call 'digital transformation'. This means a lot to me, having known the company and its people for many years. And I am sure this establishment in your market fills you not only with pride but also with confidence. From this point of view, the topic of cybersecurity may be something you are concerned about whether it belongs to your 'historical' business area or you would leave it for other more specialized players.

For the answers (all in Greek!) you shall enjoy listening to the podcast  [here](/audio/Postcast_4-Greek.m4a).
