We are happy to announce the second CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast with Juha Röning!

Juha is the Coordinator of the CS-AWARE-NEXT project and is Professor of Embedded Systems at the University of Oulu. Juha has also coordinated the original CS-AWARE project.

He has three patents and has published more than 300 papers in the areas of computer vision, robotics, intelligent signal analysis, and software security. He is currently serving as a Board of Director for euRobotics aisbl. He is also a steering board member of ARTMIS-IA.

Here the questions:

1. You have coordinated the first CS-AWARE project which was an Innovation Action and now you are leading the second CS-AWARE-NEXT project that is a research action. Which are the differences between the first and the current project?

2. You have experiences with academic or scientific entrepreneurship from several other occassions, with start-ups and entrepreneurship. Which are the necessary 'ingredients' for a success in start-up entrepreneurship? Or are all cases different?

3. How do you see the cybersecurity field and market developing? There are always expectations for fast growth in terms of number of projects, turnovers in the companies that are active in the area and a fast way to create new jobs, but sometimes the higher the expectations, the bigger the problems they create for a healthier and more sustainable growth in the market.

For the answers you have to listen to the podcast [here](/audio/episode2_Juha_Roning.mp3).
