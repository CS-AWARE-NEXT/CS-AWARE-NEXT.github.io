ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºThe EU funded Horizon project CS-AWARE-NEXT, that will take part to AI4FUTURE and present an innovative cybersecurity framework to better address a dynamic and constantly changing landscape. 

CS-AWARE-NEXT provides local supply chain dependencies with a socio-technical support for local/regional cooperation and collaboration, since the local/regional level is currently not considered in the multi-level cybersecurity framework established by the 2013/2020 European cybersecurity strategy and the NIS/NIS2 directive. 

On Friday at 4 pm Dr. Adamantios Koumpis (Research and Teaching Officer at Cologne University), together with Matteo Bregonzio, PhD will present this great opportunity.
