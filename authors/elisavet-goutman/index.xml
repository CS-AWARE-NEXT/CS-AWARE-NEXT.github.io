We are happy to announce the fourth podcast with Elisavet Goutman of OTS Greece. The reason we shall experiment with podcasts in national languages, namely not in English is rather simple: English can be our common working language for Deliverables, and can be ideal for reaching out researchers, but if we truly want to walk the last mile and increase the visibility of the project to a large audience in the participating countries, then the best is to create content in the different national languages.</description></item><item><title>Greece's new Cybersecurity Bill</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/11/greece-new-cybersec-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/11/greece-new-cybersec-law/</guid><description>Greece&amp;rsquo;s new Cybersecurity Bill A bill on cyber security, telecommunication privacy issues and personal data has been submitted to the Greek parliament.
