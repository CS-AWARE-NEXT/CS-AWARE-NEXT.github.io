The company itself is a successful spin-out of the previous CS-AWARE Innovation Action and considered as a success story because we exhibited commitment to build a sustainable business that will help local public organisations increase their awareness and build capacities to successfully fight with cyber security threats.</description></item><item><title>Turning the Internet into a meaningful (data) space!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/11/05/cs_aware_next_turning_internet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/11/05/cs_aware_next_turning_internet/</guid><description>Turning the Internet into a meaningful (data) space! Last week I attended the works of the 1st International Conference on FAIR Digital Objects. One may wonder what FAIR Digital Objects are – and then visit the Web page of the Fair Digital Objects Forum to learn more.
Before entering the details of what FDOs are, it may be worth to spend some little time and explain what FAIR is about. More and more projects and research ‘endeavours’ and ‘ventures’ take it as a prerequisite, that all data to be collected – processed – managed – stored should be FAIR.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity infrastructures - 'Ferrari fast and Fiat cheap'</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/27/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_infrastructures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/27/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_infrastructures/</guid><description>Cybersecurity infrastructures - &amp;lsquo;Ferrari fast and Fiat cheap&amp;rsquo; The title of this blog may seem deliberately provocative but it is actually not meant at all as such. We could also have used some other car brand – so we could have named the blog: ‘Why not buy a Porsche and pay the price of a Volkswagen Polo?’ The original ‘Ferrari fast and Fiat cheap’ idea comes from Alberto Savoia and a presentation he made about ‘How to Succeed by Failing ‘Ferrari Fast’’ which you can listen to as a podcast here.</description></item><item><title>A great base scenario for CS-AWARE-NEXT?</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/20/cs_aware_next_a_great_base_scenario/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/20/cs_aware_next_a_great_base_scenario/</guid><description>A great base scenario for CS-AWARE-NEXT? Don&amp;rsquo;t remember if have heard of this incident before, but this could actually be a great base scenario for CS-AWARE-NEXT. It is about the May 2021 ransomware attack on the Health Service Executive (HSE).
At the end of the year 2021, a report was published, that had been commissioned by the Health Services Executive (“HSE”). The report counts about 100 pages – so it is not what one might regard as a convenient reading for an evening discussion.</description></item><item><title>The hard thing about impact</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/13/cs_aware_next_the_hard_thing_about_impact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/13/cs_aware_next_the_hard_thing_about_impact/</guid><description>The hard thing about impact It is now over 8 years that the ‘Hard Thing about Hard Things’ has become a best-selling reader on entrepreneurship. The reason that the audience liked the book may be because the author is not afraid to take for granted that mistakes happen and are an inevitable, or as I prefer to call: a ‘shadow capital’ for every enterprise and venture.
Ben Horowitz, the author of the books, is apart from businessman and investor also active as blogger, devoting time and energy to communicate his ideas and also have them tested with a wider audience.</description></item><item><title>The world is changing…</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/05/cs_aware_next_the_world_is_changing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/05/cs_aware_next_the_world_is_changing/</guid><description>The world is changing… … and startups are considered as agents of change.
Young people now, as well as less young ones, quit their jobs ‘en masse’ and find substance and what each of us may understand in our own, individual ways as ‘meaning in life’ – this is what became to get known as the Great Resignation or the Big Quit.
Many of us have been praised within conservative education and life cultures, feeling that taking risks is worth once you have a big organisation to support you.</description></item><item><title>Another attack…</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/01/cs_aware_next_another_attack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/01/cs_aware_next_another_attack/</guid><description>Another attack… Last week, another attack against the UK&amp;rsquo;s National Health Service: this time the target was the NHS 111, a hot line helps people get the right advice and treatment when they urgently need it. So it is not about cinema ticket reservations or something else that one would consider as less important, less critical or less urgent.
You can read about this here and here. So it is nothing new at all – same attacks took place last May in Carinthia in Austria.</description></item><item><title>CS-AWARE Next Project successfully launched!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/08/23/cs_aware_next_launched/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/08/23/cs_aware_next_launched/</guid><description>CS-AWARE Next Project successfully launched!! A new Horizon Europe research project to help organisations and local &amp;amp; regional networks improve cybersecurity awareness and collaboration.
A pan-European consortium led by the University of Oulu in Finland has successfully launched a new Horizon Europe project. The project is called CS-AWARE-NEXT and builds on the legacy of the CS-AWARE project, that was part of the Horizon 2020 Programme, a predecessor of Horizon Europe. The project application has been been successfully evaluated for all three dimensions related to scientific excellence, societal and economic impact and the quality of the research plan implementation.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/04/28/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/04/28/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello world!
