description: "The applicability and relevance of the objectives addressed by this project in the context real-world
scenarios needs to be ensured through agile, iterative and collaborative design, implementation and validation. This
involves the inclusion of the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders (e.g. academic, industry, authorities, end-
user) in all project phases (e.g. requirements analysis, design, implementation, validation). For this purpose,
realistic scenarios will be developed together with the stakeholders to serve as basis for design and validation. The
project consortium includes relevant public and NIS sector partners in two local/regional case studies in Greece and
Italy (including NIS critical sector organisations from health care and water supply/distribution, and major Industry
representatives), as well as a relevant CERT/CSIRT partner to ensure the inclusion of actors from the multi-level
European cybersecurity environment."
