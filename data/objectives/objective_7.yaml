description: "While frameworks and methodologies defined through the project objectives are designed to be
generic and can in general be adapted to any advanced cybersecurity solutions like SIEM (Security Information and
Event Management) systems, a reference implementation of all frameworks and methodologies (policy framework,
local/regional collaboration, AI framework, disaster recovery/business continuity framework, KPI based
benchmarking and profiling framework, system self-healing and cybersecurity information sharing) will be
provided in the context of the CS-AWARE platform developed during the CS-AWARE H2020 project, allowing to
integrate the novel aspects developed in this project by extending existing components (awareness and visualization,
data collection and AI, system self-healing, cybersecurity information sharing), and adding/integrating new
components to the CS-AWARE framework (cybersecurity policy management, local/regional collaboration,
business continuity, KPI based benchmarking and profiling)."
