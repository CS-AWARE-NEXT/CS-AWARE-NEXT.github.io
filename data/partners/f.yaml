description: "The Consorzio ASI Foggia is a regional industry association. The role in CS-AWARE-NEXT is intended to be the organization and management of local/regional collaboration in the Foggia region. The main contributions are related to the local/regional collaboration of WP2 (Objective 2) and the evaluation and validation of the project (Objective 8), contributing to the end-user requirements analysis and validation in several additional work packages. Originally the Consorzio was supposed to encourage the development of new industrial activity through the establishment of the necessary infrastructure and services. In addition, these consortiums oversaw the establishment of infrastructure through the appropriate regulatory plans of the cities in which they were located. While the paradigm of guided industrial development has been superseded in the South of Italy (as in other areas of Europe) and more attention is being paid now to softer factors like tourism, environment, quality agriculture, and energy.  The Consortiums are beginning to transform themselves into locally based organizations dedicated to providing services to local industries and attracting external investment with the assistance of Invitalia."
