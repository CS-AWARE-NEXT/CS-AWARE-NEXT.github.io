description: "The municipality of Larissa has been a piloting partner in the original CS-AWARE project, with the pilot
CS-AWARE platform still being used by the municipality. In CS-AWARE-NEXT, Larissa participates again as a
pilot partner in the context of extending the knowledge and awareness gained to collaboration on the local/regional
level, with Larissa intended to be the entity that organizes and manages the cooperation and collaboration in the
Larissa region. The main contributions are related to the local/regional collaboration of WP2 (Objective 2) and the
evaluation and validation of the project (Objective 8), contributing to the end-user requirements analysis and
validation in several additional work packages."
