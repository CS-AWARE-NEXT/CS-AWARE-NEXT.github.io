We could also have used some other car brand – so we could have named the blog: ‘Why not buy a Porsche and pay the price of a Volkswagen Polo?’ The original ‘Ferrari fast and Fiat cheap’ idea comes from Alberto Savoia and a presentation he made about ‘How to Succeed by Failing ‘Ferrari Fast’’ which you can listen to as a podcast here.</description></item></channel></rss>
