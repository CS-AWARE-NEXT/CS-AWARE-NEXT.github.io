As machine learning models are becoming more prevalent in our lives, they are also becoming more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Data poisoning attacks are one of the most insidious and difficult-to-detect kinds of threats on ML models.
Data poisoning is a type of adversarial attack in which a cybercriminal injects malicious data into a machine learning model.</description></item></channel></rss>
